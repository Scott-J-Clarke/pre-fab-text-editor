# pre-fab-text-editor

## Description

This is a basic text editor.

It was built with Express, JavaScript, IndexedDB, service workers, and a few npm packages.

This text editor:

- uses IndexedDB to create an "object store" with GET and PUT methods
- can be downloaded as an application to your desktop 
- works without an internet connection

Through building this text editor, I:

- became more familiar with how webpack "bundles" files and sends them to the "dist" folder
- gained some insight into how service workers are used
